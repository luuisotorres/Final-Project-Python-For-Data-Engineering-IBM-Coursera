# About 

This repository contains my input to the Final Project for the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-engineering">Python Project for Data Engineering</a> course developed by IBM and available on Coursera. 

In this project, we developed a Python script to extract, transform, and load real-world data about the world's largest banks into a database for further processing and querying.

This project is relevant as it:
- **Automates financial reporting processes** by creating reusable and scalable ETL pipelines.
- **Demonstrates the practical use of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows**, a crucial skill for modern data engineering.
- **Integrates multiple tools and libraries** such as Python, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and SQLite, showcasing how to handle real-world data end-to-end.

### Key Features
- Web scraping from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup
- Currency conversion using exchange rates
- Data transformation with Pandas
- SQLite database integration
- Logging system
- Automated query reporting


# Project Scenario

You have been hired as a data engineer by research organization. Your boss has asked you to create a code that can be used to compile the list of the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. Further, the data needs to be transformed and stored in GBP, EUR and INR as well, in accordance with the exchange rate information that has been made available to you as a CSV file. The processed information table is to be saved locally in a CSV format and as a database table.

Your job is to create an automated system to generate this information so that the same can be executed in every financial quarter to prepare the report.

## Project Tasks

**Task 1:**
Write a function `log_progress()` to log the progress of the code at different stages in a file `code_log.txt`. Use the list of log points provided to create log entries as every stage of the code.

**Task 2:**
Extract the tabular information from the given URL under the heading 'By market capitalization' and save it to a dataframe.
a. Inspect the webpage and identify the position and pattern of the tabular information in the HTML code
b. Write the code for a function `extract()` to perform the required data extraction.
c. Execute a function call to `extract()` to verify the output.

**Task 3:**
Transform the dataframe by adding columns for Market Capitalization in GBP, EUR and INR, rounded to 2 decimal places, based on the exchange rate information shared as a CSV file.
a. Write the code for a function `transform()` to perform the said task.
b. Execute a function call to `transform()` and verify the output.

**Task 4:**
Load the transformed dataframe to an output CSV file. Write a function `load_to_csv()`, execute a function call and verify the output.

**Task 5:**
Load the transformed dataframe to an SQL database server as a table. Write a function `load_to_db()`, execute a function call and verify the output.

**Task 6:**
Run queries on the database table. Write a function `load_to_db()`, execute a given set of queries and verify the output.

**Task 7:**
Verify that the log entries have been completed at all stages by checking the contents of the file `code_log.txt`.
